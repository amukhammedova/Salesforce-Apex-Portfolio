1. Challenge: Rest Api Authentication through Postman.

Solution: 

Sfdc side:
-I created a Connected App under App Manager
-Gave it a Name, Provided email address, Enabled OAuth Setting (under API), Callback URL: https://localhost, Selected Full access, and Perform requests at any time(refresh token, offline_access) under Selected OAuth Scopes
-Once saved, it generated a new Consumer Key and Consumer Secret

Postman side:
-Created a RestAPI Collection, then added a request for RestAPI Authentication
-Method: Post
-Endpoint: https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
-Headers: 
      Authorization: Bearer <Security_Token>
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
-Body:

      Client_Secret
      Username
      Password: <passwordSecurityToken>

-Send Request: 
      Status Code 200Ok, AccessToken, InstanceURl is received back.
