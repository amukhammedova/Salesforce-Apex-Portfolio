10. Real-Time Integration Using Platform Events
Objective: Implement event-driven integrations.

Challenge:

Use Platform Events to trigger a real-time notification to an external system.
For example, when a Case is created, send a real-time event to an external monitoring system (e.g., a Heroku app).
Bonus:

Build a flow to handle and process Platform Event responses in Salesforce.
Simulate and test end-to-end scenarios with real-time events.
