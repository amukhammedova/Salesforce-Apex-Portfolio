7. Real-World Scenario: Multi-System Integration
Objective: Simulate a real-world scenario with multiple systems involved.

Challenge:

Integrate Salesforce with a CRM-like HubSpot (or another tool).
Fetch customer leads from HubSpot into Salesforce.
When a lead converts to an Opportunity in Salesforce, send it back to HubSpot for marketing purposes.
Bonus:

Add a custom setting or UI to manage integration configurations (e.g., API keys, endpoints).
Ensure your integration is scalable and well-documented.
