8. Apex REST API (Expose Salesforce as an API)
Objective: Learn to expose Salesforce data to external systems.

Create a custom Apex REST API that exposes data from a Salesforce object (e.g., Accounts or Opportunities).
Secure the API using OAuth and Named Credentials.
Test your API by making requests from a tool like Postman.
Bonus:

Add support for filtering or querying data via URL parameters.
Build a client-side application (e.g., a React app) that consumes your custom API.
