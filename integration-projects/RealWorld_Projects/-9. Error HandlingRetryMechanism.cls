9. Error Handling and Retry Mechanism
Objective: Practice building robust integrations that can handle failures.

Challenge:

Use the Currency Exchange Rates API to fetch exchange rates.
Simulate errors (e.g., invalid API keys or timeouts) and implement retries using exponential backoff logic.
Bonus:

Log errors to a custom object in Salesforce for tracking purposes.
Build a UI to manually retry failed API calls.
